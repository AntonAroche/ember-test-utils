This repository has _devDependencies_ on all of the same libraries that are _dependencies_ of `ember-frost-test` 
because it is a dependency of `ember-frost-test` but needs its own copy for its own development. These _devDepenencies_
entries are to be kept in sync version-wise not because they need to be but to keep things cleaner.
